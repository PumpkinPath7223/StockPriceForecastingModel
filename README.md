# StockPriceForecastingModel

Designed and trained LSTM models in PyTorch for stock price forecasting achieving 15% lower RMSE and 65% directional accuracy.

Built an automated pipeline with yfinance and pandas for data collection, preprocessing, and backtesting, integrating visual dashboards (Matplotlib/Plotly) and extending the framework to IoT energy datasets for broader time-series forecasting applications.
